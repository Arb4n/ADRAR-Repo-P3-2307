KARIM FAKIR


I discovered what would maybe be 
in the future 
a brilliant entrepreneur. 

1.
This man doesn't need his own nickname, 
his name is his name, and he 
adorns wears it proudly. 

2.
And if just karim doesn't 
dexcribe him well, 
persistent would. 

3.
Young Karim, 
having finisehd his
baccalaureat professionel, 
spent two years polishing 
his skills as an optical fiber engineer 
in an bachelor in electronics. 
His electrical maintenance 
professional degree obtained, 
the said skills allowed him to work 2 years 
for Sogetrel not so far,
in Gard, near Nimes, where they have the big structures 
that demand it. 
during this period, he could live a few months 
with his family in London, and near Brighton, 
cities that impressed him and seem
to have marked him for life. 
Maybe the foreboding of a future life 
drinking tea with shortcakes ? 

4.
And he will surely do it 
if he puts his mind to it. 
BECAUSe he is PERSISTENT !!!!
He akready told you, 
and if you ask him about one of 
his strongest points, 
he will persistently tell 
you again
he is persistent. Okay? 
But you could say also 
that he is meticulous and 
thourough. 
Looking for his flaws, guess one? 
Well we didn't find anything ! Hah! 

5.
You could just compare Karim 
with a proud Lion, patient and thorough, 
nothing more or he shall bite you 
to put you in your place.

6.
what was once a cub was shaped in this proud lion 
by his life in London with his pride, I mean 
family in London, and his scholar 
and professional life, which have let 
him find his focus in life : web development. 

7.
On this note, his favorit apps 
are by now graphic design apps, 
which helped him create plans 
in his line of work. 
He loves Google, what helps 
him every day. 


8.
His Experiencein It is mainly about hardware, 
like drawing plans,
electrical architecture, telecomunications,
working with this full racks of computer / computers systems 

9. 
English makes him reminisce about his life there, 
and the English way of life he likes so much, its culture, language, 
and every other country of the commonwealth 
and other english speaking countries like USA and Canada ; 
he seems especially interested by North America too. 
Maybe we can add to his qualities a thirst for discovery 
and exploration? 

And you all have discovered but a little part of Karim Fakir,
the rest is up to you.
